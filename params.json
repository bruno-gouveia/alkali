The alkali library is a lightweight set of modules for accessing simple native JavaScript objects with modeling and reactivity capabilities, and creating reactive UIs based on native elements. Alkali uses categorical models with contextualized calculations and caching, with an invalidation-based notification system. This makes it possible to build highly efficient and fast applications, with UI components driven by standard JavaScript objects using modern functionally reactive techniques, and without any large framework impositions.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
